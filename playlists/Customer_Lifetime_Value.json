Netflix believes you can. As impersonal as this sounds, knowing customer value is incredibly useful to any business. <br><br>Knowing how much money a customer spends on your products over time is essential to your company&apos;s budgeting. It allows you to justify spend on things like marketing or product improvement, because you can estimate the return that you will get on this investment through customer retention and new customer acquisition. Without understanding the concept of lifetime value, Netflix may never have given us original content like: Orange is the new black, Daredevil or Stranger things.<br><br>Interested in learning about how to run your own business?

CLV models provide crucial inputs to inform marketing acquisition decisions, retention measures, customer care queuing, demand forecasting, etc. They are used and applied in a variety of verticals, including retail, gaming, and telecom.<br><br>This tutorial is separated into two parts:<br><br>In the first part, we will provide a brief overview of the ins and outs of probabilistic models, which can be used to quantify the future value of a customer, and demonstrate how e-commerce companies are using the outputs of these models to identify, retain, and target high-value customers.<br><br>In the second part, we will implement, train, and validate predictive customer lifetime value models in a hands-on Python tutorial. Throughout the tutorial, we will use a real-world retail dataset and go over all the steps necessary to build a reliable customer lifetime value model: data exploration, feature engineering, model implementation, training, and validation. We will also use some of the probabilistic programming language packages available in Python (e.g. Stan, PyMC) to train these models.<br><br>The resulting Python notebooks will lay out the foundation for more advanced models tailored to the specifics of each business setting. Throughout the tutorial, we will give the audience additional tips on how to tweak the models to fit different business settings.<br><br>www.pydata.org<br><br>PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
