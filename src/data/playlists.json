I&#x2019;ll be giving you the step-by-step business blueprint and ultimate guide on how to start your own cold email lead generation business and get your first paying client within 48 hours using the exact cold email template that I used back when I used to do this. (Posted below)<br><br>This is the perfect business for somebody with no prior internet marketing experience. I recommend this to anybody who&#x2019;s just starting out and may be intimidated by learning things like Shopify drop-shipping, Instagram and social media marketing, SEO, or creating their own products.<br><br>&#x266B; Music: &#x201C;Vortex&#x201D; by Jonny Poole &amp; &#x201C;Wide Wake&#x201D; (Instrumental) by Davis Absolute<br><br>The main service you&#x2019;ll be offering is collecting cold email leads for businesses which you can easily charge $300/month and upsetting them on managing their cold email campaigns or email marketing for them. Usually an extra $200-$400/month.<br><br>Step 1 &#x1F449; How &amp; Where to Collect Leads<br><br>First things first. To make sure your leads are able to be used in a mail merge to send out customized emails you need to properly format the columns of information you&#x2019;ll be collecting.<br><br>Always be familiar with your email template and how the information is going to be inserted. Make sure your emails are going to read naturally. The most common information you&#x2019;ll be collecting is a contact name, email address and/or phone number, a portfolio item to further personalize the email and the source of where you discovered your lead.<br><br>Step 2 &#x1F449; Using Email To Get New Clients<br><br>Once you have a list of leads ready to contact you&#x2019;re going to send out a cold email campaign.<br><br>I suggest using and customizing the cold email template I&#x2019;ll paste below as it would always reap a 30%+ response rate and helped me close my first $300/mo client within 48 hours!<br><br>I personally recommend using YesWare, but you can also use others like Streak CRM and there is a free Google Docs add-on called Just Another Mail Merge you can use as well.<br><br>Make sure to always double check and preview everything before you send out your batch of emails.<br><br>Step 3: &#x1F449; Up-Sell Your Clients in Extra Cold Email or Campaign Management Services<br><br>Once you&#x2019;ve closed your first couple of clients and they&#x2019;re pleased with your service, I suggest up-selling them on extra email marketing services.<br><br>You can offer things like writing and sending their cold email campaigns for them, or using an autoresponder to manage all of their email marketing.<br><br>&#x1F4E7; Copy My Cold Email Templates Below.&#x1F447;<br><br>(The first I used to recruit my first agency client within 48 hours.)<br><br>____________________________<br><br>Subject Line: Quick question about {!Company}<br><br>Hey {!Name},<br><br>I just came across {!Company} on {!Source} and I really love what with what you guys have going on.

Netflix believes you can. As impersonal as this sounds, knowing customer value is incredibly useful to any business. <br><br>Knowing how much money a customer spends on your products over time is essential to your company&apos;s budgeting. It allows you to justify spend on things like marketing or product improvement, because you can estimate the return that you will get on this investment through customer retention and new customer acquisition. Without understanding the concept of lifetime value, Netflix may never have given us original content like: Orange is the new black, Daredevil or Stranger things.<br><br>Interested in learning about how to run your own business?

CLV models provide crucial inputs to inform marketing acquisition decisions, retention measures, customer care queuing, demand forecasting, etc. They are used and applied in a variety of verticals, including retail, gaming, and telecom.<br><br>This tutorial is separated into two parts:<br><br>In the first part, we will provide a brief overview of the ins and outs of probabilistic models, which can be used to quantify the future value of a customer, and demonstrate how e-commerce companies are using the outputs of these models to identify, retain, and target high-value customers.<br><br>In the second part, we will implement, train, and validate predictive customer lifetime value models in a hands-on Python tutorial. Throughout the tutorial, we will use a real-world retail dataset and go over all the steps necessary to build a reliable customer lifetime value model: data exploration, feature engineering, model implementation, training, and validation. We will also use some of the probabilistic programming language packages available in Python (e.g. Stan, PyMC) to train these models.<br><br>The resulting Python notebooks will lay out the foundation for more advanced models tailored to the specifics of each business setting. Throughout the tutorial, we will give the audience additional tips on how to tweak the models to fit different business settings.<br><br>www.pydata.org<br><br>PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States.
